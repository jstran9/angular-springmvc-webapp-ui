# This is a repository following the Udemy course [here](https://www.udemy.com/build-an-angular-and-spring-mvc-web-application)

# Notes (section 6 video 20)
    - For videos 15-25(end of course) I may not update this README unless I have issues and I write about the solution here. 
    - I had an issue where after POST'ing to create a book I had an error that was causing the post request to create the book but still return an error code
    and I found the solution to be to add the 'responseType': 'text' to my httpOptions.
    
# Summary
- I am watching this as I still need to improve my skills using Angular and Spring MVC to build full-stack web applications.
